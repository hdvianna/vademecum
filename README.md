# Vademecum, my living book of how-to's

_Vade mécum_ is a latin word that literally means "come along". But it today it represents any reference book to accomplish some task. This _Vade mécum_ is organized by topics, such as databases, network, operational systems or programming, and compreends tasks that I have done or I do in my professional activities as a software developer.
